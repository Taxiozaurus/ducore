# DuCore - Dusky Core PHP framework

Lightweight collection of classes for setting up a small webpage in no time with no extra libraries.

This codebase borrows many ideas from many places to create very simple (or at least attempts to create a very simple) php "framework" that does not weight down onto the system too much.

> Note that this codebase was built for PHP 7.1+

### Autoloading rules:
+ All classes must be inside `classes` folder
+ All classes must be namespaced with their respective folder names (ex: `Controllers` inside controllers folder)
+ Classes may have underscore names but CamelCase naming is preferred

Example:
```php
// This will load file User.php inside folder classes/models
use Models\User;
// Also allowed
new Models_User;
// This should produce the same result but is not guaranteed
```

### Structure

All framework specific files are located in the root and in `ducore` folder.
This repository comes with basic configuration files added and basic `index.php` to allow for easy start of a new project.

Following is the current general code structure
```py
root

|--classes # Should contain all project classes
|  |--controllers       # All your controllers should be here
|  |  `--BaseController # Basic controller included in the project
